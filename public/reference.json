    "CardType": "Ability",

You may play an Ability only if you control either a Neutral unit or a unit that shares at least one elemental type with the Ability. Abilities never enter play—resolve their effects, then put them into your grave. Effects vary widely (damage, draw, stat changes, tokens, etc.) based on cost, rarity, and story relevance. Many Abilities have the Reaction subtype, allowing play during the Reaction Phase and in reaction windows."

    "CardType": "Event",
    "CardTypeDescription": "Event cards are one-shot plays that disrupt opponents or accelerate your plan. They never enter play—resolve the effect, then put the card into your grave. Their effects (damage, draw, resource bursts, tokens, temporary stat changes) scale with cost, rarity, and story relevance. Unlike Abilities, Events rarely have the Reaction subtype, but those that do can be played during reaction windows."

    "CardType": "Partner",
    "CardTypeDescription": "Partner cards are the heart of deckbuilding, setting your deck’s elemental identity and theme. At game start, your Partner sits in the Partner Zone in Rookie form. As you gain experience, it evolves into its Ultimate form. While Ultimate, you may play your Partner to the field once as a Unit. If it would be banished or defeated while in play, return it to the Partner Zone in Rookie form instead."

  {
    "CardType": "Support",
    "CardTypeDescription": "Support cards provide persistent effects that bolster your forces or bend the rules. Play them to your Support Zone; once placed, they can’t be moved and remain until banished or defeated. Support effects can deal damage, draw cards, produce resources, create tokens, or modify stats, often granting ongoing benefits to units. The Augment subtype lets a Support modify a unit in the same column; the augmented unit gains the Support’s effects (marked with the Add icon)."
  },
  {
    "CardType": "Shield",
    "CardTypeDescription": "Shield cards are foundational, producing the resources that power your plays and forming a barrier between you and enemy units. Play up to two Shields each turn; when you play your first Shield that turn, draw a card. Most Shields are basic and produce two resources of a single element. The ten elements are Earth, Fire, Ice, Nature, Neutral, Storm, Synthetic, Toxic, Void, and Water. You may include any number of basic Shield cards in your deck."
  },
  {
    "CardType": "Unit",
    "CardTypeDescription": "Unit cards are your primary path to victory. Play them to the Unit Zone; once placed, a unit can’t be moved to a different unit space. Units feature abilities, attacks, blocks, and stats that reflect their cost, rarity, and story relevance. Unless a card says otherwise, units can attack the turn they enter the Unit Zone. When attacking, you must target the opponent’s Shield Zone until it has 0 cards; after that, you can attack the opponent directly, reducing their HP by the attacker’s ATK. If the opponent declares a blocker, the attack retargets that unit and the two units battle."
